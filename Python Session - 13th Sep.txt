OOPS
---------
-class	: is wrapper of data member and function
-object	: is an instance of class

-encapsulation  : is wrapping of data memeber and function in one unit i.e encapsulation
		: this is default concept
		: every class is by default encapsulated 
			  
-abstraction  : expose the essential features of class/method and hide the implementation i.e. abstracton 
		:example
				print()


-constructor	: is function which invoke/call/execute automatically when object will create	
		: def __init__() : is system defined/reserved function which is constructor

		-> constructor cannot be invoke/call explicitly 
		-> constructor cannot have return type 

-deconstructor :is function which invoke/call/execute automatically when object will be deleted 
		: def __del__() : is system defined/rserved function 
		-> deconstructor cannot be invoke/call explicitly 
		-> deconstructor cannot have return type 


		
-inheritence  : to extend one class features/functions to another class
		 (parent - child relationship)
	      : There are following types of inheritnece:
		i. single level
			A -> B
		ii. multi level 
			A -> B -> C ... 
		iii. tree/hirarchical 
			A ->B , C, D -> M,N
		iv. hybrid
				A ->B -> C
				M-> N,C 

		v.  multiple  
			A,B,C -> D			


-overriding
**python doesn't support overloading
		add(a,b):
		add(a,b,c)	:
